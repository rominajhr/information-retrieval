Information retrieval systems rely on indexing, searching, and ranking documents.
An inverted index maps each term to a list of documents.
Tree based data structures such as B trees allow efficient lookup operations.
Algorithms for search and retrieval must balance speed and memory usage.
Efficient query processing is essential for scalable systems.
