Machine learning models process data using mathematical representations.
Neural networks consist of layers, weights, and activation functions.
Training a model requires computing gradients and updating parameters.
Data indexing and search structures are important for large scale learning systems.
Efficient storage and retrieval improve performance in data driven applications.
